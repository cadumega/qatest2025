# Test Plan for Login Feature

## Overview
This test plan outlines the comprehensive testing approach for the Next.js login feature. The login functionality includes username and password input fields with validation, authentication logic, and appropriate redirection/error messaging.

## Test Environments
- Local development environment
- CI/CD pipeline environment

## Test Types

### 1. Functional Testing

#### 1.1 Rendering Tests
| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Priority |
|----|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| F01 | Verify login page loads correctly | Login form renders with username field, password field, and login button | High |
| F02 | Verify form labels and placeholder text | All form elements have appropriate labels and placeholder text | Medium |

#### 1.2 Validation Tests
| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Priority |
|----|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| F03 | Submit form with empty username | Error message displayed indicating username is required | High |
| F04 | Submit form with empty password | Error message displayed indicating password is required | High |
| F05 | Submit form with whitespace-only username | Error message displayed indicating valid username is required | Medium |
| F06 | Submit form with whitespace-only password | Error message displayed indicating valid password is required | Medium |

#### 1.3 Authentication Flow Tests
| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Priority |
|----|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| F07 | Submit form with valid credentials | User is redirected to dashboard page | High |
| F08 | Submit form with invalid username | Error message displayed indicating invalid credentials | High |
| F09 | Submit form with invalid password | Error message displayed indicating invalid credentials | High |
| F10 | Verify login state persistence | After successful login, user remains logged in when navigating between pages | Medium |

### 2. Negative/Boundary Testing

| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Priority |
|----|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| N01 | Submit form with very long username (>100 chars) | Application handles input appropriately (either truncates, rejects with clear message, or properly processes) | Medium |
| N02 | Submit form with very long password (>100 chars) | Application handles input appropriately | Medium |
| N03 | Test with special characters in username | Application handles special characters correctly | Medium |
| N04 | Test with special characters in password | Application accepts special characters in password | Medium |
| N05 | Test rapid multiple login attempts | Application handles multiple requests appropriately (no crashes) | Low |

### 3. Security Testing

| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Priority |
|----|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| S01 | Test SQL injection patterns in username field | Application sanitizes input and prevents injection attacks | High |
| S02 | Test XSS payloads in username field | Application sanitizes input and prevents XSS attacks | High |
| S03 | Verify error messages don't reveal credential validity | Error messages should be generic without indicating which credential was incorrect | High |
| S04 | Check password field type | Password field should mask entered characters | High |
| S05 | Verify network requests don't expose credentials in URLs | Credentials should be sent in request body, not as URL parameters | High |
| S06 | Test browser back button after logout | User should not be able to access protected content after logout by using browser back button | Medium |

### 4. Accessibility Testing

| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Priority |
|----|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| A01 | Test keyboard navigation | All form elements must be accessible via keyboard (Tab key navigation) | High |
| A02 | Test form submission via keyboard | Form can be submitted using Enter key | Medium |
| A03 | Check correct use of ARIA attributes | Form elements have appropriate ARIA labels | Medium |
| A04 | Verify contrast ratio of text | Text has sufficient contrast against background | Medium |
| A05 | Check screen reader compatibility | Screen readers can correctly identify and describe form elements | High |
| A06 | Validate HTML structure | HTML has proper semantic structure for accessibility | Medium |

### 5. Performance/Usability Considerations

| ID | Test Case | Expected Result | Priority |
|----|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| P01 | Measure login form submission response time | Response time should be under 2 seconds | Medium |
| P02 | Test login under simulated slow network | Application should provide appropriate feedback during slow connections | Low |
| P03 | Verify error message visibility | Error messages should be clearly visible and descriptive | High |
| P04 | Check input field responsiveness | Input fields should respond immediately to user input | Medium |
| P05 | Test form behavior during page zoom | Form should remain usable at different zoom levels | Low |

## Test Data

### Valid Credentials
- Username: `testuser`
- Password: `password123`

### Invalid Credentials
- Invalid username: `wronguser`
- Invalid password: `wrongpassword`

### Special Input Test Data
- SQL Injection: `' OR 1=1 --`
- XSS Payload: `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`
- Long string: String of 200 random characters

## Test Execution Strategy
1. Run unit tests during development
2. Run integration tests before merging code
3. Run E2E tests in CI/CD pipeline

## Assumptions
1. The login feature uses a hardcoded username/password for authentication
2. The application will have a dashboard page for redirection after successful login
3. The application has appropriate error handling mechanisms
4. Form validation occurs both client-side and server-side
